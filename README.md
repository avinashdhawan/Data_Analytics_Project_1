# DataClass-Project-1
# GTA_Housing_Price_Comparison

  The goal of this project was to understand the Toronto Housing Market and see if we could see any factors that would impact the prices we see in the market.  
  Due to time constraints and uncertainty of finding a correlation we looked at 3 suburbs of the Toronto area, namely, Mississauga, Brampton, Oakville and Burlington.  
  We used a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mnabaee/ontarioproperties) for the house prices and then compared that with:
    1. Elementary and highschool ranking for the schools in the area as prepared by the Fraser Institute.
    2. Used the time to reach the main downtown Toronto train station from the various commuter train stations in the communities above

# Getting Started
